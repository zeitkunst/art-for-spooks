                <h1>About <em>Art for Spooks</em></h1>
                <p><em>Art for Spooks</em> is an augmented book that takes a poetic angle to electronic surveillance. It combines texts and images from “leaked” NSA documents that evidence mundane concerns of NSA employees with grooming etiquette, gossip and surveillance at the work place; the development of encryption and psychological profiling tools modeled on alleged historical links between magicians and the military; and a delirious imaginary steeped in the world of modern folklore, populated as is with UFOs, popular media archetypes of evil and good, as well as (apparently) a taste for buffalo meat, high art, and orientalist and gendered themes. These materials are juxtaposed with graphics read through a tablet interface. The act of reading generates randomized data in the forms of new images and texts which are concurrently uploaded to various social media platforms. The traces of this data are refracted through algorithmic manipulation. Art for Spooks suggests that the intense categorization and cataloguing of facts, phenonema, and life under current modes of surveillance, demands the invention of new ones that resist the stultifying effects of this kind of instrumentalization. With this in mind, the project concerns the creation of feedback meant to augment the paranoiac impulses of the spy (unburdened by such trivialities as plausibility or verification) through the fabrication of evidence for unprovable verification and the grafting of this evidence on the world.</p>
                
                <h1>Getting the book</h1>
                <p>This app requires the <em>Art for Spooks</em> book, available for download by tapping on the "DOWNLOAD BOOK" button on the home screen of the app.</p>
                <h1>Using <em>Art for Spooks</em></h1>
                <p>Hold the tablet over one of the images in the book, ensuring that the entire image is visible. Watch as the image changes before your eyes!</p>
                <p><em>Note:</em> tapping or swiping the augmented images does not do anything.</p>
                
                <h1>Sharing</h1>
                <p>While viewing one of the images through the tablet, tap the "share" icon (<img width="24" src="share.png" alt="Share Icon"/>) to upload a screenshot to your Flickr photostream or Twitter stream, if configured. The share icon only appears when viewing an image.</p>
                <p>You need to authenticate to Flickr and/or Twitter in order to share the screenshots to your respective accounts. You can authenticate to Flickr by tapping on "Setup" in the home screen. To authenticate to Twitter, you will need to do that through your iOS Settings.</p>
                <p>For technical reasons, each time you share an image, the shared image is saved to your Camera Roll. This also enables you to e-mail or manipulate these shared images in separate programs.</p>
                
                <h1>Website and Contact</h1>
